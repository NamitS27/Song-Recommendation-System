### Introduction
Spotify is one of the leading audio streaming platforms, hosting almost all song collections present in the world. We selected an independent [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) derived from [Spotify Public API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) comprising of more than 1.2 Million songs, to design a machine learning model for the song recommendation system. The recommendation is done based on different audio features by the means unsupervised learning algorithms which classifies the data into different clusters. The system will recommend songs belonging to a particular set of cluster based on different features of the song. The dataset consists of various attributes and features of the songs, which helps in grouping them based on certain similar premises.
